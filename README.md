# :recycle: ReproHacking - Plan of Action

In contrast to other ReproHacks, here we focus on one particular paper rather than an entire list of papers. To this end, we selected the following article:

Luis M. Vilches-Blázquez & Daniela Ballari (2020):
**Unveiling the diversity of spatial data infrastructures in Latin America: evidence from an exploratory inquiry**, Cartography and Geographic Information Science, DOI: [10.1080/15230406.2020.1772113](https://doi.org/10.1080/15230406.2020.1772113)


# :computer: Form Teams

Feel free to either join the predefined teams *Beginners*, *Advanced*, or *Experts*, create your own team, or work individually on the paper. 

## Beginners
The paper is analysed with respect to their published resources and the original analysis is re-run in order to see whether the same results will be generated.
_Participants are expected to have some basic knowledge of R_

## Advanced
The paper's analysis is re-implemented in a Python Jupyter notebook to see whether the same results can be generated in a different computational environment. 

_Participants are expected to have some basic knowledge in R and Python_

## Experts

A computational environment for both, the original analysis and the re-implemement analysis, is created.

_Participants are expected to have some basic knowledge in R, Python and Docker_




:books: Reproduce
---
- Attempt to reproduce papers from available materials and documentation
- Make notes about your experiences, in particular with respect to how easy it is to:
    - :earth_africa: navigate the materials
    - :repeat: reproduce the analysis
    - :recycle: reuse the materials
